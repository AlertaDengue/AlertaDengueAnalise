\title{Define conditions to issue a 2 level alert Green/Yellow.}
\usage{
twoalert(obj, cy)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{dataset from the mergedata function containing at least SE, and the
variables used for alert calculation.}

\item{cy}{criteria to set the yellow alarm, written as a vector with three elements.
The first is the condition (see the example), the second is the number of times the
condition must be tru to issue the yellow alert, and the third, the number of weeks
false to turn off the alert (green).}
}
\value{
data.frame with the week condition and the number of weeks within the
last lag weeks with conditions = TRUE.
}
\description{
This function is meant to be used when case data is absent.
In this scenario, only two levels exist: Yellow if environmental conditions
required for positive mosquito population growth are detected, or if social activity
increases. Green otherwise. But clearly, the user can define any rule.
